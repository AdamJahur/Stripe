# PalPay

PalPay is a simple and easy way for customers to make payments and companies to get paid. Companies are able to track their customers payment histories and customers are able to see balances they owe as well as make whole payments on balances, see their account balance and pending charges as well as add new credit card information.

# Technology used

Stripe's API was used to host all credit card numbers and allowed us to test in a test mode feature. We also have the ability to go live and accept actual credit card payments. PHP was the main languaged used to give stripe all its abilities and partnered with HTML and CSS to present it in a simplist yet classy look.
